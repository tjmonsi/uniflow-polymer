/**
 Key behavior that must be assigned to all elements that need to access
 application state and/or have access to the application element. The element is
 notified of any changes to application's state, as well as all its properties
 when they're modified by state mutator elements. `state-path` property must
 be used to identify path to element's state in application state tree.

 ### Example:

 #### HTML:

    <template>

      <div>Value A: [[state.valueA]]</div>
      <div>Value B: [[valueB]]</div>

    </template>

 #### JavaScript:

    Polymer({
      is: 'my-element',

      properties: {
        valueB: String
      },

      behaviors: [
        UniFlow.StateAware
      ]

    });

 When above element is declared as follows:

    <my-element state-path="state.myElement"></my-element>

 it will be notified about changes (and render those) to `state.valueA` or
 `state.myElement.valueB` in action dispatchers or other state mutating
 elements.
